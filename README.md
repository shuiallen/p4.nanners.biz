CSCI-E15 Project 4

This goal of this website is to keep track of things in lists in several different ways, and help you make a list of things to do today.

You must create a user, sign in and view your profile  (All code from P2)

Working functionality
- create new tasks
- view a list of all open tasks
- the tasks in the list are sortable by dragging them

Not Working!
- Requires ability to update a task
	- Record time spent on an individual task
	- edit a task
	- update the status to done

- create a quick list
	- this is a list of items that you might not create individual tasks for - they are kind of temporary
	- or you can use this to create lists such as grocery or packing lists
	- you can add items to a quick list, put the items into a document and save it, or print it;
	- it is loadable

- tasks have a 'done' status - false for not done, true for done, you can find open or done tasks

- build a todo today list by moving tasks from a big list to the today tab
	- put the items into a document and save it, it is printable

- assign tasks to a project, find tasks assigned to a project
- add a tag to tasks, to search for them later
